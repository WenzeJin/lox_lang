# Language support for Lox

This repository is a work in progress. I will implement the Lox language following the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## About Lox

Lox is a simple, dynamically typed, interpreted language. It is a mix of C and JavaScript. It has a C-like syntax and garbage collection like JavaScript.

## Repo structure

- jlox: Java implementation of the Lox interpreter.
- clox: C implementation of the Lox VM.
- more to come...
